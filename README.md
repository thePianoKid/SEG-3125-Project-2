# Steampunk Education - 1st Iteration
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/0e3114b6-990c-4d78-a8fb-397636cf308f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/steampunk-education-step-3/deploys)

## Purpose
This is the first iteration of my site. This site was made for uOttawa's SEG 3125 course. Although this is a school project, I decided to make a website for a real company. 

Steampunk Education is a STEM education company that I co-founded with my brother; after 4 years of running the company, we have taught over 1000 students across Ontario and Québec.

> Please note that is version of the site is frozen as per the assignment instructions. You can find the most recent version of the site [here](https://github.com/thePianoKid/Steampunk-Education).

## Personality
Steampunk’s voice should be professional, but since Steampunk targets education centres, media management should also strive to inject humour and lightheartedness into Steampunk’s content. Steampunk shies away from the buzzwords and stock photos that permeate most corporate sites. Steampunk draws from industrial design since it is the most common aesthetic in STEAM. Clean lines and simplistic shapes should permeate Steampunk’s website and ad campaigns.

## Personas
---
### Persona 1
**Name:** Berta Gideon

Berta is the program coordinator for the Almonte public library. She sees the value in STEM education, but is more interested in the language arts and is not comfortable teaching STEM. She is looking for someone who can teach STEM-themed workshops at the library. 

Goals:

- Find a program that works with the library’s budget
- Make sure the program aligns with the library’s learning goals
- Contact the Steampunk team to ask specific questions

*Interactive processes used to accomplish Berta's goals:*

### Persona 2
**Name** Tyler Robinson (Suggested on PeerGrade)

Tyler is a high school student looking for a workshop to learn about VR game development and possibly go into this field of study. 

He is completely new to the ideas of workshops and finds it a little daunting. He is looking to talk to someone knowledgeable to guide him through the process as he wants to do everything perfectly. 

He is also a user who likes to do things efficiently as he doesn't have much free time. 

Tyler is very comfortable with technology, he does his school work almost exclusively on his touchscreen laptop and he is looking into software / game development as a career. 

Goal:

- Communicate is an interactive process that would help him achieve a goal of booking with some help as he has never done this before.
