# Steampunk Education - 1st Iteratinon
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/0e3114b6-990c-4d78-a8fb-397636cf308f/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/steampunk-education-step-3/deploys)

This is the first iteration of my site. This site was made for uOttawa's SEG 3125 course. Although this is a school project, I decided to make a website for a real company. 

Steampunk Education is a STEM education company that I co-founded; after 4 years of running the company, we have taught over 1000 students across Ontario and QuÃ©bec.

> Please note that is verison of the site is frozen as per the assignment instructions. You can find the most recent version of the site [here](https://github.com/thePianoKid/Steampunk-Education).
